# Stewart Island February 2017

We went to Stewart Island.  It was fun.

- Here is an [interactive map](leaflet.html) which lets you see pictures and movies where they actually happened.
- Or you can go through this [slide set](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx4MNG6PFPgARUtFT0dfRGV3d0U/view?usp=sharing), which has a few more pictures (although no movies), and the pictures are bigger and nicer to look at.  When you click on the link you'll get an "Oops! there was a problem previewing this document" message.  That's because it's big.  It's ok to download it (takes about a minute on our fastish connection), then to watch it.  We recommend you put your browser onto full screen (F11) if you can, then keep pushing "page down" (or down and right arrows, as you prefer) to navigate through.  Might only work on a desktop...
