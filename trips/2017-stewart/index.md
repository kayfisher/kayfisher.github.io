# Stewart Island February 2017

We went to Stewart Island.  It was fun.

- Here is an [interactive map](leaflet.html) which lets you see pictures and movies where they actually happened.
- Or you can go through this [slide set](slides.html), which has a few more pictures, and they are bigger.  We recommend you put your browser onto full screen (F11) if you can.  Might only work on a desktop...
