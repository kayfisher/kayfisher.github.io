# Stewart Island February 2017

We went to Stewart Island.  It was fun.

- Here is an [interactive map](leaflet.html) which lets you see pictures and movies where they actually happened.
- Or you can go through this [slide set](slides.html), which has a few more pictures (although no movies), and the pictures are bigger and nicer to lolok at.  We recommend you put your browser onto full screen (F11) if you can, then keep pushing "page down" (or down and right arrows, as you prefer) to navigate through.  Might only work on a desktop...
